In memory of other days,

<p>

<p>
A noble and a generous mind
</p>
<p class="i3">
      Was Jack's;
</p>
<p>
Folks knew he would not talk behind
</p>
<p class="i3">
      Their backs:
</p>
<p class="i1">
  But when some maiden fresh and young,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  At Jack a bit of banter flung,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  She soon discovered that his tongue

<p>
A flirt of most engaging wiles

<p class="i3">
      Until

<p class="i1">
  Her slave (and he was not the first)

  His glance a strong box might have burst,

<p class="i3">

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
One April morning, clear and fair,

<p class="i3">

Of staying home and idling there

<p class="i3">
      In sloth

<p class="i1">

</p>
<p class="i1">
  "Oh, what's the sense in sitting still?
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Let's mount the slope of yonder hill."
</p>
<p class="i3">
      And she was nothing loth.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
But as she answered: "What's the use?"

<p class="i3">
      The gruff

<p class="i3">
      Enough.
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Your doting parents water lack;
</p>
<p class="i1">
  We'll fill a pail and bring it back."
</p>
<p class="i1">

<p>
Thus hand in hand the tempting hill

<p class="i3">
      And failed!
</p>
<p class="i1">
  One backward start, one step too bold,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  And down the hill the couple rolled,

<p class="i1">
  Resembling, if the truth were told,
</p>
<p class="i3">
      A luggage train derailed.

With eyes ablaze with anger, she

THE BLATANT BRUTALITY
<br />
<span class="s05">OF</span>

LITTLE BOW PEEP
</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Though she was only a shepherdess,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Tending the meekest of sheep,
</p>
<p>
Never was African leopardess
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Crosser than Little Bow Peep:
</p>
<p>
Quite apathetic, impassible
</p>
<p class="i2">
    People described her as: "That
</p>
<p>
Wayward, contentious, irascible,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Testy, cantankerous brat!"
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet, as she dozed in a grotto-like
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Sort of a kind of a nook,
</p>
<p>
She was so charmingly Watteau-like,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    What with her sheep and her crook;
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>10</a></span>
</p>
<p>
"She is a dryad or nymph," any
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Casual passer would think.
</p>
<p>
Poets pronounced her a symphony,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    All in the palest of pink.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Thus it was not enigmatical,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    That the young shepherd who first
</p>
<p>
Found her asleep, in ecstatical
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Sighs of felicity burst:
</p>
<p>
Such was his sudden beatitude
</p>
<p class="i2">
    That, as he gazed at her so,
</p>
<p>
Daphnis gave vent to this platitude:
</p>
<p class="i2">
    "My! Ain't she elegant though!"
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Roused from some dream of Arcadia,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Little Bow Peep with a start
</p>
<p>
Answered him: "I ain't afraid o' yer!
</p>
<p class="i2">
    P'raps you imagine you're smart!"
</p>
<p>
Daphnis protested impulsively,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Blushing as red as a rose;
</p>
<p>
All was in vain. She convulsively
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Punched the young man in the nose!

All of it's true, every word of it!

    I was not present to peep,
</p>
<p>
But if you ask how I heard of it,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Please to remember the sheep.
</p>
<p>
There is no need of excuse. You will
</p>
<p class="i2">
    See how such scandals occur:

If you recall Mother Goose, you will

THE DISCOURAGING DISCOVERY

LITTLE JACK HORNER

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
A knack almost incredible for dealing with an edible
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Jack Horner's elder sister was acknowledged to display;
</p>
<p>
She labored hard and zealously, but always guarded jealously
</p>
<p class="i2">
The secrets of the dishes she invented every day.
</p>
<p>
She'd take some indigestible, unpopular comestible,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And to its better nature would so tenderly appeal
</p>
<p>
That Jack invoked a benison upon a haunch of venison,
</p>
<p class="i2">
When really she was serving him a little leg of veal!
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>22</a></span>
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Jack said she was a miracle. The word was not satirical,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For daily climbing upward, she excelled herself at last:
</p>
<p>
The acme of facility, the zenith of ability
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was what she gave her brother for his Christmas Day repast.
</p>
<p>
He dined that evening eagerly and anything but meagerly,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And when he'd had his salad and his quart of Extra Dry,
</p>
<p>
With sisterly benignity, and just a touch of dignity,
</p>
<p class="i2">
She placed upon the table an unutterable pie!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Unflagging pertinacity, and technical sagacity,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Long nights of sleepless vigil, and long days of constant care
</p>
<p>
Had been involved in making it, improving it, and baking it,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Until of other pies it was the wonder and despair:
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>23</a></span>
</p>
<p>
So princely and so prominent, so solemn, so predominant
</p>
<p class="i2">
It looked upon the table, that, with fascinated eye,
</p>
<p>
The youth, with sudden wonder struck, electrified, and thunder struck,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Could only stammer stupidly: "Oh Golly! What a pie!"
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
In view of his satiety, it almost seemed impiety
</p>
<p class="i2">
To carve this crowning triumph of a culinary life,
</p>
<p>
But, braced by his avidity, with sudden intrepidity
</p>
<p class="i2">
He broke its dome imposing with a common kitchen knife.
</p>
<p>
Ah, hideous fatality! for when with eager palate he
</p>
<p class="i2">
Commenced to eat, he happened on an accident uncouth,
</p>
<p>
And cried with stifled moan: "Of it one plum I tried. The stone of it
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had never been extracted, and I've broke a wisdom tooth!"
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>24</a></span>
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Jack's sister wept effusively, but loudly and abusively
</p>
<p class="i2">
His unreserved opinion of her talents he proclaimed;
</p>
<p>
He called her names like "driveller" and "simpleton" and "sniveller,"
</p>
<p class="i2">
And others, which to mention I am really too ashamed.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The moral</span>: It is saddening, embarrassing, and maddening

A stone to strike in what you thought was paste. One thing alone

</p>
<p class="i2">
To strike but paste in what he fondly thought to be a stone.

<p>
Little Miss Muffet discovered a tuffet,

(Which never occurred to the rest of us)

<p>
And, as 'twas a June day, and just about noonday,
</p>
<p class="i1">
She wanted to eat&mdash;like the best of us:
</p>
<p>
Her diet was whey, and I hasten to say
</p>
<p class="i1">
It is wholesome and people grow fat on it.
</p>
<p>
The spot being lonely, the lady not only
</p>
<p class="i1">
Discovered the tuffet, but sat on it.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
A rivulet gabbled beside her and babbled,

As rivulets always are thought to do,

And dragon-flies sported around and cavorted,
</p>
<p class="i1">
As poets say dragon-flies ought to do;
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>28</a></span>
</p>
<p>
When, glancing aside for a moment, she spied
</p>
<p class="i1">
A horrible sight that brought fear to her,
</p>
<p>
A hideous spider was sitting beside her
</p>
<p class="i1">
And most unavoidably near to her!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Albeit unsightly, this creature politely

Said: "Madam, I earnestly vow to you,

<p>
I'm penitent that I did not bring my hat. I
</p>
<p class="i1">
Should otherwise certainly bow to you."
</p>
<p>
Though anxious to please, he was so ill at ease
</p>
<p class="i1">
That he lost all his sense of propriety,
</p>
<p>
And grew so inept that he clumsily stept
</p>
<p class="i1">
In her plate&mdash;which is barred in Society.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
This curious error completed her terror;
</p>
<p class="i1">
She shuddered, and growing much paler, not
</p>
<p>
Only left tuffet, but dealt him a buffet
</p>
<p class="i1">
Which doubled him up in a sailor-knot.
</p>
<p>
It should be explained that at this he was pained:
</p>
<p class="i1">
He cried: "I have vexed you, no doubt of it!
</p>
<p>
Your fist's like a truncheon." "You're still in my luncheon,"

Was all that she answered. "Get out of it!"

Extremely hard to please:

His appetite was most immense.

His nerves were all on edge.

Monotonously talk,

Until his rage burst every bound.

And then, with words that no one ought

      And ten assorted pies, and there,
</p>
<p class="i5">
          His hand upon his heart,

He paused to choose between an apple dumpling and a tart.

A MAN IN OUR TOWN

<p>
There was a man in our town,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Half beggar, half rapscallion,
</p>
<p>
Who, just because his eyes were brown,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Was thought to be Italian:
</p>
<p>
And, though with much insistence
</p>
<p class="i1">
He said that people erred,
</p>
<p>
And bitterly to Italy
</p>
<p class="i1">
He frequently referred,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    The false report, as is the way
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Of false reports, had come to stay!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
So every one who'd been to Rome
</p>
<p class="i1">
By aid of Cook's or Gaze's,
</p>
<p>
Would call upon him at his home
</p>
<p class="i1">
To flaunt Italian phrases.
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>72</a></span>
</p>
<p>
"<span lang="it_IT">Capite Questa lingua?</span>"
</p>
<p>
The inquiry would be:
</p>
<p>
"<span lang="it_IT">Pochissimo? Benissimo!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span lang="it_IT">Vi prego, ditemi,</span>
</p>
<p class="i1">
<span lang="it_IT">Siete voi contento qua,</span>
</p>
<p class="i1">

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The victim, plunged in deep disgust,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Grew nervous, could not slumber;
</p>
<p>
Said he, "I'm called Italian, just
</p>
<p class="i1">
Because my eyes are umber,
</p>
<p>
And if this persecution
</p>
<p class="i1">
Is ever to be stopped,
</p>
<p>
Some stern and stoic, hard, heroic
</p>
<p class="i1">
Course I must adopt!"
</p>
<p class="i2">
    And so, to everyone's surprise,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    He calmly scratched out both his eyes!
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The neighbors said: "So strange a thing
</p>
<p class="i1">
Might seem to be an omen.
</p>
<p>
We <i>thought</i> his wits were wandering,

</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>73</a></span>

<p>
And so at him by legions,
</p>
<p class="i1">
By bevies, hosts, and herds,
</p>
<p>
Professors, purists, tramps, and tourists
</p>
<p class="i1">
Screamed Italian words.
</p>
<p class="i2">
    Perceiving all he'd done was vain,
</p>
<p class="i2">
    He scratched his eyesight in again.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
<span class="smcap">The moral</span>: If your neighbors say

You're one thing or another,

You'll find there isn't any way

Their prejudice to smother.
</p>
<p>
What matter if they think you

<p class="i1">
From Italy or Greece?
</p>
<p>
I beg you, treasure no displeasure:
</p>
<p class="i1">
Bow and hold your peace.

    Like Omar, underneath the bow

Built a bustling business, and in course

more ridiculous,

The lazy steed to cheer up, she'd a bell upon

<p class="i2">
Had only three passions in life,

And always, so rigid his habits,

<p class="i2">
He frolicked at home until two,

'Twas little he cared for the troubles

KING KARL THE FIRST

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
For hunger and thirst King Karl the First
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had a stoical, stern disdain:
</p>
<p>
The food that he ordered consistently bordered
</p>
<p class="i2">
On what is described as plain.
</p>
<p>
Much trouble his cook ambitiously took
</p>
<p class="i2">
To tickle his frugal taste,
</p>
<p>
But all of his savoury science and slavery
</p>
<p class="i2">
Ended in naught but waste.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
Said the steward: "The thing to tempt the King
</p>
<p class="i2">
And charm his indifferent eye
</p>
<p>
No doubt is a tasty, delectable pasty.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Make him a blackbird pie!"
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>108</a></span>
</p>
<p>
The cook at these words baked twenty-four birds,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And set them before the King,
</p>
<p>
And the two dozen odious, bold, and melodious
</p>
<p class="i2">
Singers began to sing.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
The King in surprise said: "Dozens of pies
</p>
<p class="i2">
In the course of our life we've tried,
</p>
<p>
But never before us was served up a chorus
</p>
<p class="i2">
Like this that we hear inside!"
</p>
<p>
With a thunderous look he ordered the cook
</p>
<p class="i2">
And the steward before him brought,
</p>
<p>
And with a beatified smile: "He is satisfied!"
</p>
<p class="i2">
Both of these innocents thought.
</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>
"Of sinners the worst," said Karl the First,
</p>
<p class="i2">
"Is the barbarous ruffian that
</p>
<p>
A song-bird would slaughter, unless for his daughter
</p>
<p class="i2">
Or wife he is trimming a hat.
</p>
<p>
We'll punish you so for the future you'll know
</p>
<p class="i2">
That from mercy you can't depart.
</p>
<p>
Observe that your lenient, kind, intervenient

He saw that the cook in a neighboring brook
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was drowned (as he quite deserved),
</p>
<p>
And he ordered the steward at once to be skewered.
</p>
<p class="i2">
(The steward was much unnerved.)
</p>
<p>
"It's a curious thing," said the merciful King,
</p>
<p class="i2">
"That monarchs so tender are,
</p>
<p>
So oft we're affected that we have suspected that
</p>
<p class="i2">
We are too kind by far."

<p>
A gander dwelt upon a farm

<p class="i2">
And no one could resist him,

<p class="i2">
His neighbors would have missed him:

His scorn for any loud display,

</p>
<p>
He loved to poke, he loved to peek,

<p>
In every knothole, so to speak,
</p>
<p>
He quickly thrust his prying beak,

<p class="i2">
For what was hid he hated.

The farm exhausted: "Now," said he:

His mind made up, he followed it,
</p>
<p>
Relying on his native wit,

And soon had wandered, bit by bit,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Through all his master's mansion.

<p>
"At least," he said: "It's not my fault

</p>
<p class="i2">
And glanced into the lean-to.

For, seeing not the farmer's dame,

<p class="i2">
Into her room he wandered,
</p>
<p>
And mounting nimbly on the bed:

<p>
"Why, bless my careful soul!" he said:

"These pillows are as hard as lead.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
